            <h3>Name: Paa Kwesi Gyebi-Arthur</h3>
            <p><strong>Student ID:</strong> 21095115</p>
            <p><strong>Index Number:</strong> 4098524</p>
            <p><strong>Program:</strong> Computer Engineering - Elon 1</p>
            <h4>Why I Chose This Program</h4>
            <p>
                I choose this programme because I have a keen interest in computers and I really like the way they function. 
                It is really fascinating! I chose computer engineering and not computer science because I really like the hardware part of computers. 
                Additionally, I chose this programme because with the knowledge in both hardware and software, computer engineers can create startups, 
                develop new technologies, and contribute to economic growth. There is also a wider range of career opportunities in the job market for computer engineers.
